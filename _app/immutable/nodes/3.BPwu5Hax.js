			desire to observe contradictory principles, leading to a result that pleases no one.)</p> <p>In any case, we need to work with IJMES. It would be good to have a variation of the standard
			for romanizing Afghan / South Asian Persian, a.k.a. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dari" class="text-blue-700 anyfine:hover:underline">Dari</a>.” (NB: Different adjustments would be needed for Tajik Persian.) The changes involved are
			few but impactful. They are as follows:</p> <ul class="list-disc"><li>Consonantal<span class="mx-1.5">و</span>becomes
				<em class="text-green-800">w</em>, not <em>v</em>.</li> <li>The <em>silent hāʾ</em> ending becomes <em class="text-green-800">-a</em>, not
				<em>-ih</em>. (One happy consequence of this is that it meshes better with the IJMES
				romanization of Arabic words ending in <em>tāʾ marbūṭa</em>. For example,
				<em>madrasa</em> would be the same coming from either language.)</li> <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimaq_dialect#Phonology" class="text-blue-700 anyfine:hover:underline"><em>majhūl</em> vowels</a>—<em class="text-green-800">ē</em> in place of <em>ī</em>,
				<em class="text-green-800">ō</em> in place of <em>ū</em>—are notated as appropriate. See,
				for example, <em class="text-green-800">khurshēd</em>
				vs. <em>khurshīd</em>, <em class="text-green-800">kōh</em> vs. <em>kūh</em>. (It is on the
